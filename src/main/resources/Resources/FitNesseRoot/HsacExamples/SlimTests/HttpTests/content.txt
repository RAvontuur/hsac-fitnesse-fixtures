!-(Xml)HttpTest-! defines a basic language (a DSL of sorts) to interact with a website via HTTP requests (allowing SOAP (and REST) services to be tested). The XML subclass adds functionality to perform checks using XPath expressions on the response received.
This basic functionality will suffice for many tests, but can be extended by creating a custom subclass. 

The tests in this suite show example usage of this fixture:
>HttpGetTest shows how an example GET requests, specifying parameters in the query string.
>HttpPost1Test sends a POST request to a SOAP service, also adding an HTTP header.
The >HttpPost2UsingScenarioTest makes multiple SOAP calls to a service, where scenario parameters are used to change an input variable's value for each call.
>HttpPost3UsingFreemarkerTemplateTest shows the usage of a [[Freemarker][http://freemarker.org]] template to define the content of a SOAP request. This allows for dynamic request structure.

|get from <url>                              |Sends a GET to the specified url (parameters can be added using 'set value for').                                                                                             |
|post <body> to <url>                        |Sends a POST containing the specified body to the url.                                                                                                                        |
|post template to <url>                      |Sends a POST to the specified url, determining the body by combining the configured template and values (see 'set value for' and 'template')                                  |
|template <location>                         |Configures the Freemarker template to use on next call using 'post template to'.                                                                                              |
|set value <value> for <name>                |Stores the value for either a query or template parameter with the supplied name.                                                                                             |
|set value <value> for header <name>         |Stores the value for an HTTP header to add to subsequent requests.                                                                                                            |
|clear values                                |Clears the list of name/value pairs to be added to GET requests or template evaluation.                                                                                       |
|clear header values                         |Clears the list of HTTP headers to be sent with requests.                                                                                                                     |
|request                                     |Returns the last url (including parameters) used for 'get from' or the body used for 'post (template) to'. Intended to be used in combination with the 'show' command.        |
|response                                    |Returns the last response body returned. Intended to be used in combination with the 'show' or 'check' commands.                                                              |
|html response                               |Returns the last response body returned as HTML to be embedded in the test result table (in combination with the 'show' command).                                             |
