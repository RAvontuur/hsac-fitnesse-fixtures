!-BrowserTest-! defines a basic language (a DSL of sorts) to interact with a website via a browser. A heuristic is used to find elements using end user terms.
The language supported by !-BrowserTest-! is defined by its public methods, which can be used in combination with Slim's standard script verbs (e.g. check, ensure, reject, show).
This basic functionality will suffice for many tests, but can be extended by creating a custom subclass. 

The tests in this suite show example usage of this fixture:
>ScriptTest shows the basic functionality of !-BrowserTest-! to test websites.
>ScenarioTest takes this to the next level by using a parameterized script (i.e. scenario).
The >TableTemplateTest simplifies the parameterization of the script.
>CustomFixtureTest shows the usage of a custom subclass of !-BrowserTest-! to make test content more descriptive by encapsulating knowledge of the site's HTML in Java code.

The main commands/keywords (i.e. public methods) offered by !-nl.hsac.fitnesse.fixture.slim.web.BrowserTest-! are listed below.
The heuristic to find places tries a number of translations of end user terms to Selenium 'find' commands (e.g. is a full or partial label given, a link's or button's text, a placeholder). The first find that results in an element on the page is used by !-BrowserTest-!.
